# Final-Project
My Final Project for Android Club
\
\
I have attempted to create a TODO app for my final project.
\
\
The main part of this app which handles the task entering is handled by the file Todo.js and task.js is called in by Todo.js which is then imported in the main App.js to make the final code simpler.My app also shows the date which you have added the task. 
The App.js file handles other parts of the app apart from the task entering such as stack,bottom drawer navigation and some styling elements.
\
\
I have used a dark theme styling with some colorful elements for the app and status bar as it is more comfortable on the eyes and to give it a cooler look :)
\
\
The full demo of this app can be found in the youtube link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeLuSq17pLg

Some screenshots of the app are also shown below :
