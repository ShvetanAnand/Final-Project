# Final-Project
My Final Project for Android Club
\
\
I have attempted to create a TODO app for my final project.
\
\
The main part of this app which handles the task entering is handled by the coding in the files Todo.js and task.js. task.js is called in by Todo.js which is then imported in the main App.js to make the final code simpler.
\
\
My Coding App.js file handles other parts of the app apart from the task entering such as stack,bottom drawer navigation and some styling elements.
\
\
I have used a dark theme styling with some colorful elements for the app and status bar as it is more comfortable on the eyes and to give it a cooler look :)
\
\
The full demo of this app can be found in the youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYobIYuGHSM
\
\
If any issues in demo video or screenshots shown here I have also  generated keystore file in JDK bin, copied it to my project directory and used that alias and password to build a signed apk of my app using android studio build tab. 
\
That file is also attached in this repository just in case. The apk can be found in the path android/app/release/app-release.apk
\
\
Some screenshots of the app are also shown below :
